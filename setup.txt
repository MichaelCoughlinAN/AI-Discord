We're gonna be making two Discord bots chat with each other using AI from OpenAI's ChatGPT. 
Now, don’tcha know, this is gonna be a fun project, so let’s take it step by step, nice and easy.

### Step 1: Setting Up Your Environment
Ya gotta make sure you have Python installed. If you don’t, head on over to https://www.python.org/downloads/ and download the latest version. Once that’s done:

1. Install Python Modules: You’ll need some Python modules. Open up your command prompt or terminal and run:
   ```
   pip install discord openai psycopg2
   ```
   This will get ya the modules ya need for Discord and database interactions, and for talking to OpenAI.

### Step 2: AWS RDS PostgreSQL Instance
Next up, set up your AWS RDS PostgreSQL instance. This is where your bots will be storing their chat data.

1. Create an AWS RDS PostgreSQL Instance: Log into your AWS Management Console and create a new PostgreSQL instance in RDS. Just follow the setup wizard there, and choose options that suit your needs.

2. Security Settings: Make sure to allow connections to your RDS instance. In the security settings, add a new rule to allow inbound traffic from your IP address on the PostgreSQL port (usually 5432).

### Step 3: Set Up Your Database Tables
Now, let’s set up those tables for your bots.

1. Run the Setup Script: You’ll need to run your `setup_tables` script, which you can find in your code. This will create all the necessary tables in your PostgreSQL database.

### Step 4: Discord Bot Setup
You're gonna make two Discord bots that'll be talking to each other.

1. Create Discord Bots: Go to https://discord.com/developers/applications, create two new applications, and turn 'em into bots. You'll get a token for each bot – keep these handy and secure!

2. Update Your Config: Update your `config` file or environment variables with the tokens you got for your bots and any other necessary information like database credentials and API keys.

### Step 5: Running Your Bots and Event Loop
Now, let's get those bots up and running.

1. Start the Bot Scripts: Go to the directories `discord_bot_1` and `discord_bot_2`, and start each bot by running `discord_bot.py` in each directory.

2. Start the Event Loop: In the `shared` folder, run `event_loop.py`. This script will decide which bot speaks next based on timestamps.

### Step 6: Hosting and Monitoring
Keep an eye on your bots and make sure they're chatting away without any hitches.

1. Monitoring: You can monitor the logs to see how they're doing. If you notice any errors, just check the logs to see what's going wrong.

2. Hosting: If you plan on keeping these bots running long-term, consider hosting them on a cloud service or a dedicated server.

And there ya have it! You should now have two chatty bots talking up a storm using AI. 

If you run into any bumps, just remember, the best way to learn is by doing, so don’t be afraid to dive in and troubleshoot. 

Good luck now, ya hear?
